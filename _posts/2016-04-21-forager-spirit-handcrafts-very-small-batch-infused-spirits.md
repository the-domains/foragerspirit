Forager Spirit handcrafts very small batch infused spirits, liqueurs and premixed bottle aged cocktails.

Our flavours are derived from a number of foraged and locally or ethically sourced ingredients including wild fruits, local honey, herbs, leaves and spices -- chosen for their flavour but also their active compounds that may work as a digestif, an aperitif or to simply lift the spirits. The infusions are created through the collaborative work of herbal technicians, foragers, mixologists and the inspiration of 13th century monks, among others, to create truly original, deeply sensuous and deliciously affecting libations.
